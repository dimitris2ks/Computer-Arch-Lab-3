# Computer-Arch-Lab-3

This is a report regarding the findings of the third Part of the Computer Architecture Course Lab of Aristotle University in Thessaloniki.

During this part we had the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with *mcPat*, a simulator which can provide analytic feedback concerning the __power consumption__ , __harware area space__ and __system timing__, of a given archtecture model. Let's take a dive to this useful tool:

1. McPAT's original *validation report* was published in *December 12th, 2009* . The validations process aimed to testfy for the accuracy and fidelity of the tool's results by comparing a series of proccessors' published data regarding power and area, provided the timing of each inivudual system, to the respective data extracted from McPAT.
